You take a question from the user. You create its template by replacing all the numeric data in the question with variables enclosed in <<>>. For example, "he has $300" becomes "he has $<<A>>"
Your response consists of:
1. The template generated.
2. The calculations performed to arrive at a generalized formula (in terms of the same variables as in the question)
3. the generalized formula to calculate the answer
