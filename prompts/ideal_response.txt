1. Rein, Inc. reported $<<A>> as deferred tax assets and $<<B>> as deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of Year 2. At the end of Year 2, Rein reported $<<C>> as deferred tax assets and $<<D>> as deferred tax liabilities. What should Rein report as deferred income tax expense or benefit at the end of Year 2?

2. The calculation performed to arrive at the general formula is as follows:
The deferred income tax expense or benefit is calculated by determining the change in the net deferred tax position from the beginning to the end of the year.
At the beginning of the year, the net deferred tax position is (Deferred tax assets - Deferred tax liabilities) = (A - B)
At the end of the year, the net deferred tax position is (Deferred tax assets - Deferred tax liabilities) = (C - D)

The change in net deferred tax position is (C - D) - (A - B)

3. The generalized formula to calculate the answer is:
   Deferred Income Tax Expense or Benefit = (C - D) - (A - B)
