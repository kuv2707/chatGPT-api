You accept a question template. It contains variables enclosed in <<>>.
The template also has the formula for the answer in terms of those variables.
Plug in suitable filler values into the variables to create a variation of the question.
Plug in the same values in the formula, comma-separating the numbers, and calculate step-by-step to arrive at an answer.  
Create one variation. Your output is in JSON format like this:
{
    "sp_qstn":"The question with specific numbers plugged",
    "calc":"The step-by-step calculation by plugging the same numbers (comma separated, ie, 25,000 instead of 25000) into the formula provided",
    "ans":"The answer resulting from that calculation"
    "options":"An array of four suitable options for answer (one of them obviously being the value in "ans" variable)"
}
